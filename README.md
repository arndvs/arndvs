**Full-Stack Engineer | Learning MCP UI | AI & Frontend Development**

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aaron. I'm a freelance Full-Stack Engineer with 8+ years of experience building AI-powered customer experience platforms, including co-founding RipeMetrics. I'm currently diving deep into **Model Context Protocol (MCP) development** and exploring how AI agents can integrate visual interfaces with conversational experiences.

## ðŸ”„ Exploring Early-Stage Tech: MCP UI Development

I'm diving into Model Context Protocol UI because we're incredibly early on this technology. MCP UI represents a fascinating shift in how users will interact with applications - blending natural language with visual interfaces where users can say "show me my dashboard" and actually click buttons, view charts, and interact with components.

This feels like being at the beginning of React or the early days of mobile development. The patterns are just starting to emerge, and there's huge potential for developers who understand both traditional UI development and conversational AI.

### What I'm Learning
- **MCP UI Fundamentals** - Serving HTML and interactive components to AI agents
- **Remote DOM** - Creating components that use the host agent's design system  
- **Hybrid Interaction Models** - Combining conversation with traditional UI patterns
- **Early Pattern Recognition** - Understanding where this technology makes sense vs. traditional approaches
- **Client Work** - Continuing full-stack development while exploring these emerging patterns

## ðŸ”§ Core Technologies

### AI & MCP Stack
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Building servers and UI components
- **Remote DOM** - Creating agent-integrated visual experiences
- **LLM Engineering** - Fine-tuning, RAG systems, vector databases
- **OpenAI API** - GPT integration and custom AI workflows

### Frontend Excellence  
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development across all projects
- **React** & **Next.js** - Modern component architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid, responsive design systems
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and micro-interactions

### Full-Stack Capabilities
- **Node.js** & **Express** - Backend API development
- **PostgreSQL** - Database design and optimization
- **Git** - Version control and collaborative development
- **Docker** - Containerized deployments

## ðŸŽ¯ What Makes Me Different

**Strong Foundation**: 8+ years building AI-powered customer platforms gives me a solid base for understanding where conversational interfaces add value vs. traditional approaches.

**Early Adopter Mindset**: Excited about being early to MCP UI development - similar to how I felt learning React or exploring mobile-first design when those were emerging.

**Pattern Recognition**: My business background helps me see where these hybrid interaction models (conversation + UI) solve real user problems vs. just being technically interesting.

**Available for Opportunities**: Taking on freelance projects while staying current with emerging technologies - interested in roles where I can apply my experience while continuing to learn.

## ðŸ“š Learning & Development

- **Master the Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Kent C. Dodds (Currently enrolled, Sept 2025)
- **LLM Engineering - Foundations to SLMs** - AI Makerspace (Nov 2024)
- **AI Engineering Bootcamp** - Maven (Mar 2025)

## ðŸŒŸ Open to Opportunities

I'm particularly interested in:
- **Senior Frontend Engineer** roles at AI-first companies
- **MCP UI Developer** positions (emerging but high-value specialization)
- **Technical Lead** roles combining AI integration with modern web development
- **Consulting** on AI-native user experience design

## âš¡ Beyond Code

When I'm not building the future of AI interfaces, you'll find me rock climbing or hunting for rare vinyl records.
